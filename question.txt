Building devopsfetch for Server Information Retrieval and Monitoring

Objective: Develop a tool for devops named devopsfetch that collects and displays system information, including active ports, user logins, Nginx configurations, Docker images, and container statuses. Implement a systemd service to monitor and log these activities continuously.

Requirements:
Information Retrieval:
1. Ports:
   - Display all active ports and services (-p or --port).
   - Provide detailed information about a specific port (-p <port_number>).
2. Docker:
   - List all Docker images and containers (-d or --docker).
   - Provide detailed information about a specific container (-d <container_name>).
3. Nginx:
   - Display all Nginx domains and their ports (-n or --nginx).
   - Provide detailed configuration information for a specific domain (-n <domain>).
4. Users:
   - List all users and their last login times (-u or --users).
   - Provide detailed information about a specific user (-u <username>).
5. Time Range:
   - Display activities within a specified time range (-t or --time).

Output Formatting:
- Ensure all outputs are formatted for readability, in well formatted tables with descriptive column names.

Installation Script:
- Create a script to install necessary dependencies and set up a systemd service to monitor and log activities.
- Implement continuous monitoring mode with logging to a file, ensuring log rotation and management.

Help and Documentation:
- Implement a help flag -h or --help to provide usage instructions for the program.
- Write clear and comprehensive documentation covering:
  - Installation and configuration steps.
  - Usage examples for each command-line flag.
  - The logging mechanism and how to retrieve logs.
